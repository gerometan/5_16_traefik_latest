=== Running BDeploy's Web UI from VSCode

To spin up a matching frontend for the master started in Running BDeploy from Eclipse you need to start the Angular application from within VSCode.

On the command line, navigate the the ./ui/webapp directory in the repository (e.g. /work/bdeploy/bdeploy/ui/webapp) and run VSCode in the current directory using code .
Open a terminal in VSCode and run ng serve to start the Angular development server. This will take a while to compile the Web UI.
The terminal can be opened using Terminal > New Terminal.
The application will be started at http://localhost:4200 by default.
